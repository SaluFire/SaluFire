So for some reason i had to fill that nonsense above but you know what? F*ck it im gonna mess around.
looking to learn something. Also before you go... if you dont follow me you are... well a bad person i suppose. Can you even follow someone here?
welp. Ima put an easy project so that it wouldnt be __EMPTY__.
Also I use sololearn for learning so...
And you are probably better than programing than i am so respect yourself 

P.S: Help me if i had made a mistake on my Syntaxes or My own sanity.
P.S.S: 5 days later: since im a trashy dev im just learning java. so im gonna give my website here(wordpress) cuz why not? 
aaghajani.yclass2.ir
i think it would be safe unless someone break into it so...
good luck, you are on your own.
